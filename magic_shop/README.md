# magic_shop_GUI
* Application that allows the DM to populate a magic item shop with pre-selected items, with prices, book information location, and even descriptions of the items included when you hover over the item's name!
* This module is intended to make life SO much easier for the DM when the party wants to shop for magic items, instead of having to sift through your books to locate each possible item that a party could want, guesstimate what price the item should be, and then find out later you gave them a Cloak of Displacement for WAY below its actual value and made them OP (as I have done...).
* This module allows you to select how many magic items are available at a given store (between 1-20), what types of magic items are available (from ammo and consumables to weapons/armor and wondrous items), rarity of items (Common-Very Rare, with a few less OP Legendary items included with the VR), and finally the expected price range of the items (so your party can reasonably afford those items, or not if you wanna play that way...we all know they can get something like that at the next dungeon if we feel like it ;D).
* Credit is given in the code (see "magic_shop_functions" in the lib folder) for the repository which gave me a class/function for displaying magic items descriptions when hovering over the name of the item, but I will post the PDF link here from "Sane Magical Prices" where I got the cost balancing of magic items: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8XAiXpOfz9cMWt1RTBicmpmUDg/view?resourcekey=0-ceHUken0_UhQ3Apa6g4SJA

## Current Notes
* For my game, I have adjusted gold to be the only currency used, thus the price for each item has been roughly inflated by 10x its standard value. If you wish to change this back, then go to the code in the "magic_shop_GUI", and near the top there should be a **User Input** section, with a boolean variable called *standard_gp_cost*. Simply set this to "True", and the prices of all items will be reduced back to their original costs. Sorry for any hassle, I did make this for my own homebrew world!
* All items included in this application came from various sources, including the 5e Dungeon Master's Guide, Volo's Guide to Monsters, Explorer's Guide to Wildmount, and probably one or two others. I do not claim the intellectual property rights to any of these magic items; all rights go to their respective publishers, mainly Wizards of the Coast and probably the same for the EGW book (love you guys!).
