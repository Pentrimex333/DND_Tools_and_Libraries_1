It remains activated until you \nuse an action to speak the command word again.\n\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within \n30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with \nanything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. \nThis saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and \nconstructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\n\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces \nvisibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't \nneed to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic \nthat permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\n\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already \noccupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new \nprisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but \nfacing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and \nappear in unoccupied spaces near it.\n\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one \ncreature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or \ncontained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the \ncreature can then communicate normally.\n\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one \ncreature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, \nin the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.",

If the space where \nthe creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't \nenough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and \nobeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but \ntakes no other actions.\n\nThis serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. The owl can \ntelepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of \nexistence. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It \nreverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak \nthe command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, it \ncan't be used again until 2 days have passed.",
